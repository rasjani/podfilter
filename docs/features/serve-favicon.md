## ðŸŽ¯ Feature Description
Browsers request `/favicon.ico` on every page load, but PodFilter currently answers with a 404. Add a branded favicon and ensure it is served correctly so the browser no longer logs missing asset errors.

## âœ… Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Given any page is opened in a browser, When the browser requests `/favicon.ico`, Then the server responds with the favicon image and the browser displays it without console errors.
- [ ] Given the favicon is updated, When assets are reloaded, Then the new icon is returned without requiring manual cache busting instructions.

- [x] Backend changes needed
- [ ] Database changes needed
- [ ] Infrastructure changes needed
